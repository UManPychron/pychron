        saved in RGB or RGBA format; if this GC is not in one of
        these formats, it is automatically converted.

        If filename includes an extension, the image format is
        inferred from it.  file_format is only required if the
        format can't be inferred from the filename (e.g. if you
        wanted to save a PNG file as a .dat or .bin).

        filename may also be "file-like" object such as a
        StringIO, in which case a file_format must be supplied

        pil_options is a dict of format-specific options that
        are passed down to the PIL image file writer.  If a writer
        doesn't recognize an option, it is silently ignored.

        If the image has an alpha channel and the specified output
        file format does not support alpha, the image is saved in
        rgb24 format.
